# PointerGuess
This repository is created for sharing the source-code of the paper "PointerGuess: Targeted Password Guessing Model using Pointer Mechanism" sumbitted on USENIX SEC 2024

**Note** that the paper is still under review (with anonymous), thus we will open-source all of our code of this project once it has been accepted.
